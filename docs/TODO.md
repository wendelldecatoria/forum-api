# TODO

1. Write documentation for `Api\MessageController`
2. That is all.

We prefer you build a swagger spec, but if you have something else in mind which you think will be better, then
go ahead.

See: [Open API Spec](https://swagger.io/specification/)

Maybe see: [API Blueprint](https://apiblueprint.org/)
